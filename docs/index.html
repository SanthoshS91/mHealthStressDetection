										<p class="paratext">Stress is commonly defined as a feeling of strain and pressure. There is evidence that stress is linked with many diseases, playing a crucial role in the development of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, or asthma, and it also significantly influences the later course of these diseases.</p>
										<p class="paratext">New fitness trackers claim they can go beyond counting people's steps and measuring how long they sleep — now, these devices can tell people when they're stressed out. The goal is to help people identify the things that trigger their stress, so they can avoid them if possible.</p>
										<p class="paratext">Most of the devices that offer such stress detection measure the change in the interval between heartbeats — a measure known as heart rate variability. The aim of this project was to focus on determining and analyzing the vital signs which show significant change when a person was stressed.</p>

											<p><b>Data Analysis:</b>We had to update our protocol to add some actvities which would make the subject be non stressed Eg: Eating, Conversation. We worked more with the Bio-stamp Java code in order to tune the values obtained. The fluctuations did reduce, but it is still under progress. We retrieved some of data logged on to the server and started pre-processing. We decided on some of the features such as mean, standard devaiation, interquartile range etc. Started on implementing a classifier in Weka</p>

											<p><b>Smartwatch application:</b> We developed an Android wear application which can detect the heart rate values and log them on to a back-end server. We tested this at different intervals and on different subjects. We built a smartphone application which could send the data values obtained from the bio-stamp onto the server. We made the application show only the heart rate values and did not include any of the other parameters. We noticed some fluctuations in the readings and are still tweaking those values. We finished the data collection module and tested its correctness and accuracy. We finished the first draft of final paper. We prepared the midterm presentation.</p>

											<p><b>LG Smarthwatch:</b> We decided to have a backup, that is use another sensor in order to check heart rate and decided that LG W150 smartwatch was a good fit. We tried experimenting with the LG W150 smart watch, but it was facing some software issues. Some of the applications were constantly crashing and that's why we need to get our Smartwatch replaced. We recieved a new smart watch and started trying to measure heart rate in the smart watch.</p>
											
											<p><b>Bio-stamp:</b>We met Dr. Bass and Mr. Jong also joined in via Skype. He answered some of our questions and also agreed to send us a more documented code to help us understand things further. He agreed to help us in completing our task. While working with the Bio-stamp sensor, we ran into a small issue. While testing the device, one of the electrical wires snapped and the sensor isn't working anymore. We have reached out to Ha-uk, who has agreed to meet us and fix the sensor on Monday. In the mean time we are working on smartwatch and trying to log the heart rate values on to the backend server</p>

											<p><b>Project kick-off:</b> We met with Dr. Bass and his team at the Chicago campus. We learned more about the Bio-Stamp sensor and also spoke to Mr. Ha-uk who fabricated the sensor. We also got some of the Java Code which was being used by the team to obtain heart rate values on an Android Phone.We spoke about the various parameters which can be detected by the sensor and also about how it measures those parameters.</p>
											
											<p><b>Code Debugging:</b>The code provided to us was difficult to understand. We spent a lot of time trying to understand what exactly was happening through each module. We met with Dr. Bass where we noted down the parts of code which did not make sense. We setup an appointment with Mr Jong, who wrote this Java code so that he could explain it better</p>
